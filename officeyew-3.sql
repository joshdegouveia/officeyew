Once they have submitted their bid, the person looking for an installer will get multiple responses from which they can choose their preference.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The third application would be to find a freelance interior designer, Cad Designer or Commercial Interior design firm.

Governing Law; Arbitration.</strong><br />\r\nThe terms of this Agreement are governed by the laws of the United States (including federal arbitration law) and the State of California, without regard to its principles of conflicts of law, and regardless of your location. EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT, ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND YOU AGREE THAT COMPANY AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW REGARDING THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER, SUCH DISPUTES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO INTERPRETATION OR APPLICATION OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, INCLUDING THE ENFORCEABILITY, REVOCABILITY OR VALIDITY OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISION OR ANY PORTION OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISION. ALL SUCH MATTERS SHALL BE DECIDED BY AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT BY A COURT OR JUDGE. HOWEVER, AS SET FORTH BELOW, THE PRECEDING ARBITRATION REQUIREMENT SHALL NOT APPLY TO DISPUTES TO THE EXTENT RELATING TO THE INTERPRETATION OR APPLICATION OF THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER BELOW, INCLUDING ITS ENFORCEABILITY, REVOCABILITY OR VALIDITY.<br />\r\nYOU AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED AND YOU ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section or any other provision of this Agreement or in the American Arbitration Association&rsquo;s Consumer Arbitration Rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability or validity of the foregoing class action waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action, and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of such class action waiver is unenforceable, then the class, collective, and/or representative action, to that extent, must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of such class action waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.<br />\r\nThe arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by this Agreement. The Consumer Arbitration Rules are available online&nbsp;https://www.adr.org/consumer. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>19.

If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provision.

We may assign, transfer or sublicense any or all our rights or obligations under this Agreement without restriction. No waiver by either party of any breach or default under this Agreement will be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Any heading, caption or section title contained herein is for convenience only, and in no way defines or explains any section or provision. All terms defined in the singular shall have the same meanings when used in the plural, where appropriate and unless otherwise specified. Any use of the term &ldquo;including&rdquo; or variations thereof in this Agreement shall be construed as if followed by the phrase &ldquo;without limitation.&rdquo; This Agreement, including any terms and conditions incorporated herein, is the entire agreement between you and Company relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements or understandings between you and Company relating to such subject matter.

For example, we use third party machine learning software to analyze all communications through our chat feature for fraud prevention and to promote safety by blocking spam or abusive messages that may have been sent to you by any other user.

For example<br />\r\nWe use your email address and unique device identifiers to administer and protect our Platform (including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, fraud prevention, system maintenance, support, reporting and hosting of data).<br />\r\nWe use third party machine learning software to analyze all communications through our chat feature for fraud prevention and to promote safety by blocking spam or abusive messages that may have been sent to you by any other user.<br />\r\nIf you provide us with your telephone number, we may use that information to SMS verify your telephone number and increase the trust and safety of our Platform.<br />\r\nIn addition, we may aggregate and/or de-identify data about visitors to our Platforms and use it for any purpose, including product and service development and improvement activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>4.

You can request to delete your personal information by logging into your account settings on&nbsp;www.officeyew.com&nbsp;and submitting a delete request.<br />\r\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see page TBD&nbsp;below), we will delete your personal information from our records. Under certain circumstances, as allowed by law, we may delay or deny your request. Officeyew reserves the right to retain portions of your personal information for a limited time, as permitted by law. For example, for Trust and Safety purposes or to respond to a law enforcement request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>6.3 Exercising Access and Deletion Rights</strong><br />\r\nIn addition to the methods described above for exercising your delete and access rights, you may also submit a verifiable consumer request to us by sending an email inquiry to&nbsp;&nbsp;mydata@officeyew.com.<br />\r\nWe cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We reserve the right to verify your identity in connection with any requests regarding personal information to help ensure that we provide the information we maintain to the individual to whom it pertains, and allow only that individual or their authorized representatives to exercise rights with respect to that information.<br />\r\nMaking a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password-protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.<br />\r\nWe will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor&#39;s identity or authority to make the request. If you designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you may have to submit information confirming such designation.<br />\r\nFor instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see&nbsp;(Page TBD)&nbsp;below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>6.4 Response Timing and Format</strong><br />\r\nWe endeavor to respond promptly to verifiable consumer requests, and in any case no longer than forty-five (45) days from the date of such request. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.<br />\r\nAny disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request&#39;s receipt. The response we provide will also explain, if applicable, any reasons we are not able to comply with all or any portion of such request. For personal information access requests, we endeavor to provide the information in a portable format that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically in &ldquo;.csv&rdquo; files.<br />\r\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>6.5 Right to request correction</strong><br />\r\nYou have the right to request the correction of any of the personal information we have about you, although we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. In order to request the correction of your personal information, please email&nbsp;mydata@officeyew.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>6.6 Personal Information Sales Opt-Out Rights</strong><br />\r\nThe CCPA defines the terms &ldquo;sale&rdquo; much more broadly than the common interpretation of the term. For example, sharing user IP addresses with advertising platforms in order to show relevant advertising, is now considered a &ldquo;sale&rdquo; under CCPA. As part of our commitment to our users, we are extending the CCPA&rsquo;s Do Not Sell My Personal Information rights to all of our users.<br />\r\nIn order to exercise your right to opt out of the &ldquo;sale&rdquo; of your personal information as defined by the CCPA, please click the&nbsp;&ldquo;Page TBD&rdquo;&nbsp;or email&nbsp;mydata@officeyew.com.<br />\r\nYou do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>7. How long do we store your data?</strong><br />\r\nWe will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Please note that we often need to retain certain data for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>8. Technical and organizational measures and processing security</strong><br />\r\nWe maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. For example, all information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls.<br />\r\nThe safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where you have a password to access to certain parts of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.<br />\r\nPlease note, despite the measures we have implemented to protect your data, the transfer of data through the Internet or other open networks is never completely secure and there is a risk that your personal information may be accessed by unauthorized third parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>9. Links to third-party websites</strong><br />\r\nOur Platform may contain links to third party websites or apps. If you click on one of these links, please note that each one will have its own privacy policy. We do not control these websites/apps and are not responsible for those policies. When you leave our Platform, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>10. User-Submitted content</strong><br />\r\nSome features of the Services allow you to post content on our Platform or social media pages, such as photos. We do not have control over how other users who have access to the Platform will use any content you post publicly or send to them privately. We urge you to exercise discretion when sharing personal information with other users.<br />\r\nWe may also use any ad you post on officeyew, including the uploaded photo or image of the product as well as other data (including user name and location) associated with the ad, for our own advertising purposes, including social media, Facebook ads, newsletters and ads for any media.<br />\r\nTo help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users&rsquo; contact information as necessary to fulfill your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they may have access to each other&rsquo;s name, user ID, email address, and other contact information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>11. State Privacy Rights</strong><br />\r\nCALIFORNIA<br />\r\nShine the Light Law:&nbsp;California law permits residents of California to request notice of how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes or to opt out of such sharing.

This may include certain categories of information listed above as &ldquo;Not Collected.&rdquo; For example, if you chat with another user about your age or education history, we do not store this data separately or use it for any purpose. We do not mine user chat messages for information and we do not share the content of our chat messages with any third parties and we do not use it for any purpose other than facilitating a chat service between users. Therefore, we have listed certain categories of data as Not Collected since they are not intentionally collected by us or used for a business purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>11.2 Disclosure of personal information for a business purpose</strong><br />\r\nIn the preceding twelve (12) months, officeyew has disclosed the following categories of personal information for a business purpose:<br />\r\nIdentifiers reasonably capable of being associated with a person or household (such as name, online identifier, email address)<br />\r\nPersonal Information categories listed in California Customer records statute<br />\r\nCommercial Information, including products or services purchased, obtained or considered, or purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies<br />\r\nInternet or network activity and usage information<br />\r\nGeolocation Data<br />\r\nInferences about preferences, characteristics, trends, predispositions<br />\r\nWe have disclosed your personal information to the following categories of third parties:<br />\r\nCorporate Affiliates<br />\r\nThird Party Vendors and Service Providers<br />\r\nAdvertisers (for the purposes of showing you advertisements on officeyew)<br />\r\nAnalytics Providers (for obtaining analytics about the activity on our Platform)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>11.3 Sales of personal information</strong><br />\r\nWe respect your privacy and have never sold our users&rsquo; personal information as most people understand that term. Recent laws, such as the CCPA, provide California state residents various rights over their personal information and define terms like &ldquo;sale&rdquo; much more broadly than the common interpretation of the term. For example, sharing user IP addresses with advertising platforms in order to show relevant advertising, is now considered a &ldquo;sale&rdquo; under CCPA.<br />\r\nIn the preceding twelve (12) months, as defined by the CCPA, officeyew has &ldquo;sold&rdquo; (as defined in the CCPA) the following categories of personal information for a business purpose:<br />\r\nIdentifiers reasonably capable of being associated with a person or household (such as online identifier, email address)<br />\r\nCommercial Information, including products or services purchased, obtained or considered, or purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies<br />\r\nInternet or network activity and usage information<br />\r\nGeolocation Data<br />\r\nInferences about preferences, characteristics, trends, predispositions<br />\r\nAs defined by the CCPA, we &ldquo;sell&rdquo; your personal information to the following categories of third parties:<br />\r\nAdvertisers (for the purposes of showing you advertisements on officeyew); and<br />\r\nAnalytics Providers (for the purposes of obtaining analytics about the activity on our Platform).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>11.4. CA Rights</strong><br />\r\nUnder the CCPA, California residents have consumer rights including the right to access specific information and data portability; the right to request deletion of personal information; and the right to opt out of the &ldquo;sale&rdquo; of personal information (collectively &ldquo;Rights&rdquo;). We are extending these Rights to all of our users in the United States and they are described above in more detail in&nbsp;(TBD). In sum, the Rights and the methods for submitting requests are as follows:<br />\r\nConsumer Right&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Methods for Submitting Requests<br />\r\nRight of access to specific information and data portability rights&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;User Settings at&nbsp;officeyew.com<br />\r\nmydata@officeyew.com<br />\r\nRight to request deletion of personal information&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;User Settings at&nbsp;officeyew.com<br />\r\nmydata@officeyew.com<br />\r\nRight to opt out of a &ldquo;sale&rdquo; of personal information, as &ldquo;sale&rdquo; is defined under the CCPA&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Link TBD<br />\r\nmydata@officeyew.com<br />\r\nCalifornia residents also have a right not to be discriminated against for the exercise of their Rights.<br />\r\nNEVADA<br />\r\nNevada law permits residents of Nevada to opt-out of data sales by web operators. A &ldquo;sale&rdquo; under Nevada law means the exchange of personal identifiable information for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell that personal identifiable information to additional persons. Officeyew does not sell your personal information under Nevada law. However, Officeyew is offering all its users the right to opt out of the sale of personal information under the CCPA, which we believe contains a broader definition of &ldquo;sale.&rdquo; If you are a Nevada resident and would like to opt-out of a &ldquo;sale&rdquo; of your personal information in accordance with the CCPA please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>12.
